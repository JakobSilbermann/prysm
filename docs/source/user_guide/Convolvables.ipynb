    "Prysm features a rich implemention of Linear Shift Invariant (LSI) system theory. Under this mathematical ideal, the transfer function is the product of the Fourier transform of a cascade of components, and the spatial distribution of intensity is the convolution of a cascade of components. These features are usually used to blur objects or images with Point Spread Functions (PSFs), or model the transfer function of an opto-electronic system. Within prysm there is a class `Convolvable` which objects and PSFs inherit from. You should rarely need to use the base class, except when subclassing it with your own models or objects or loading a source image.\n",

    "Some models require sample spacing and samples parameters while others do not. This is because prysm has many methods of executing an FFT-based Fourier domain convolution under the hood. If an object has a known analytical Fourier transform, the class has an `analytic_ft` method which has abscissa units of reciprocal microns. If the analytic FT is present, it is used in lieu of numerical data. Models that have analytical Fourier transforms also accept sample_spacing and samples parameters, which are used to define a grid in the spatial domain. If two objects with analytical Fourier transforms are convolved, the output grid will have the finer sample spacing of the two inputs, and the larger span or window width of the two inputs.\n",
