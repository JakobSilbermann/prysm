prysm v0.19
***********

New Features
============

API Fluency
***********

- :meth:`~prysm._richdata.RichData.astype` function for converting between the various object types.  This can be used to dip into another type momentarily for one of its methods, e.g. chaining :code:`p = Pupil() p.astype(Interferogram).crop(...).astype(Pupil)`.

Propagation
***********
In this release, prysm has gained increased capability for performing propagations outside of the pupil-to-image case.
- :func:`prysm.propagation.angular_spectrum` for plane-to-plane propagation via the angular spectrum method
- :func:`prysm.propagation.fresnel_number` for computing the Fresnel number
- :func:`prysm.propagation.talbot_distance` for computing the Talbot distance
- :func:`prysm.propagation.modified_shifted_angular_spectrum` for performing off-axis angular spectrum propagations free of aliasing

Thin Film Calculation and Refractive Indices
********************************************
Prysm can now do basic multi-layer thin film calculations and compute a few related values.
- :func:`prysm.thinfilm.multilayer_stack_rt` for computing the equivalent Fresnel coefficients for a stack of thin and thick films.
- :func:`prysm.thinfilm.critical_angle` for computing the minimum angle of incidence for TIR
- :func:`prysm.thinfilm.brewsters_angle` for computing the angle at which a surface is completely unreflective of p-polarized light
- :func:`prysm.refractive.cauchy` for computing refractive index based on Cauchy's model
- :func:`prysm.refractive.sellmeier` for computing refractive index based on the Sellmeier equation

Bug fixes
=========

- :meth:`~prysm.convolution.Convolvable.save` now flips the array before writing, rendering images in the expected orientation.
- :meth:`~prysm.psf.PSF.from_pupil` now passes the :code:`incoherent` and :code:`norm` arguments to the propagation engine
- the :class:`~prysm.pupil.Pupil` constructor no longer ignores the phase parameter
- :class:`~prysm.propagation.Wavefront` no longer errors on construction
