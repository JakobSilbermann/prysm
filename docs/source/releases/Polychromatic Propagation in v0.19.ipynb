    "# Polychromatic Propagations\n",
    "\n",
    "Prysm has a long heritage solving the monochromatic problem very quickly.  However, it used a brute force 'propagate and interpolate' approach to solving the polychromatic problem.  v0.19 offers large speedup by using matrix triple product DFTs to perform polychromatic propagations.  This results in forward model times that are significantly faster, and clearer code when propagating to a grid for a detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows in the fewest possible lines the speedup by using a zero OPD circular pupil under nine discrete wavelengths.  It also shows propagating to a detector grid."

This results in some numerical errors, where the new way is error free.  At larger Qs the old way will have improved accuracy, but also increased computation time.  To show the true power of the new way, we will compare old and new for Q=8, and use the flexibility of the matrix triple product to compute a smaller output domain:"
